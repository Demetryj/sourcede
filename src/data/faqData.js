      <p key="2">
        The marketplace feature within SureCede is designed to create a more efficient and targeted
        connection between cedants and reinsurers, moving beyond the traditional, fragmented
        methods. It benefits both parties by streamlining the submission and underwriting process.
      </p>,
      <p key="3">
        {`Cedants can create a standardized, high-quality data submission. When you enter the "Deals"
        marketplace, their risk profile is presented in a format that reinsurers can easily
        understand and analyze.`}
        <br />
        This creates an environment where their submission is more likely to be considered because
        it is already organized to meet industry standards. The platform essentially makes it easier
        for cedants to get their risks in front of the right reinsurers who have a defined appetite
        for those specific risks, increasing the likelihood of a successful and efficient placement.
      </p>,
      <p key="4">
        The marketplace is a powerful tool for reinsurers too, primarily because it allows them to
        access submissions that are pre-filtered to match their risk appetite.
        <br />
        {`Reinsurers can build a detailed profile that defines their specific underwriting guidelines
        and risk appetite based on criteria such as line of business, product type, and geographical
        region. When a cedant submits a risk, the platform can automatically match it to reinsurers
        whose guidelines align with the submission. This dramatically increases the quality of risk
        submissions that land on an underwriter's desk, as they are no longer sifting through
        irrelevant deals. This targeted approach allows reinsurers to work more efficiently and
        focus on evaluating risks that are genuinely a good fit for their portfolio.`}
