                        <strong>Internal Data Access Processes and Policies – Access Policy</strong>
                        . SC Holding Company Limited’s internal data access processes and policies
                        are designed to protect against unauthorized access, use, disclosure,
                        alteration or destruction of Customer Personal Data. SC Holding Company
                        Limited designs its systems to only allow authorized persons to access data
                        they are authorized to access based on principles of “least privileged” and
                        “need to know”, and to prevent others who should not have access from
                        obtaining access. SC Holding Company Limited requires the use of unique user
                        IDs, strong passwords, two factor authentication and carefully monitored
                        access lists to minimize the potential for unauthorized account use. The
                        granting or modification of access rights is based on: the authorized
                        personnel’s job responsibilities; job duty requirements necessary to perform
                        authorized tasks; a need to know basis; and must be in accordance with SC
                        Holding Company Limited’s internal data access policies and training.
                        Approvals are managed by workflow tools that maintain audit records of all
                        changes. Access to systems is logged to create an audit trail for
                        accountability. Where passwords are employed for authentication (e.g., login
                        to workstations), password policies follow industry standard practices.
                        These standards include password complexity, password expiry, password
                        lockout, restrictions on password reuse and re-prompt for password after a
                        period of inactivity
